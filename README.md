# MySalSoft-Java-application
MySalSoft is a Java software application with graphical user interface, created using JavaFX, that facilitates the process of computing salaries for the employees of a company.
Data about employees and salaries are kept in a database.
The app mostly focuses on easing the accountantsâ€™ work, helping fulfill tasks in simpler, more efficient and more accurate ways.

There are two distinct types of accounts available within the system: an employee account and an administrator account.
The employee account provides access to an individual's current salary information, as well as the history of past salaries.

The administrator account is designed to provide additional functionality. It permits adding, removing, and modification of employee details, such as employment type, meal voucher values, and current project assignments. Each new employee added to the system is automatically assigned an employee account. Furthermore, the administrator account is responsible for salary calculations, which take into account various factors such as hours worked, extra hours, bonuses, and tax deductions if applicable. Additionally, the administrator may add, edit, or remove ongoing projects within the company.
